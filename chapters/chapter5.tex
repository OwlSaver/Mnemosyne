Run the processes asynchronously
Create specific LLM for each task
Build the Query Processing
Build the response processing agent
Build the ability to validate documents
Prepossessing the copra to identify initial Node Labels and Relationship Types
DO not clear the LTM for each run, processing the same document multiple times just serves as reinforcement
