\dedication{
In loving memory of my parents, Jack and Helen. I dedicate this work to their belief in me and the lessons they taught. From my mother, I learned what is possible through sheer determination. The memory of her returning to school to earn a master's in economics while raising our family is an inspiration that I carry with me always. From both of my parents, I received the encouragement and love of learning that made this achievement possible.

\vspace{1cm}

To my siblings, Gordon, Carole, and Iain, who have graciously and humorously allowed me to neglect them during this endeavor. I am deeply grateful for your patience and look forward to reconnecting now that it is complete.

\vspace{1cm}

To my children, Alex, Peter, and Kayla. Your unwavering support and quiet understanding have been a constant source of strength. Thank you for inspiring me to see this through.

\vspace{1cm}

And most importantly, to my lovely wife, Elaine. You encouraged me to start this journey, sustained me with endless coffee and patience when the mornings were early or the nights grew long, and became my partner in every sense of the word. You will now be living with the results, and I am eternally grateful. This achievement is as much yours as it is mine.

% Acknowledgments
\acknowledgments{
I would like to express my profound gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Elabasheer, whose mentorship was instrumental in guiding this research. He showed me the way forward when the path was unclear and challenged me to think more critically. Whenever I find myself thinking I cannot multitask or overcome a challenge, I will undoubtedly hear his voice reminding me that I must—a lesson in perseverance I will carry throughout my career.

My deepest appreciation extends to all my professors at The George Washington University who taught me during this program. Their dedication to teaching and intellectual generosity created the rich academic environment and provided the abundant knowledge that were essential for this journey.

I am also deeply grateful to my West Chester University Dean, Dr. Burns, who served as a steadfast source of support. He was always available to listen to my trials and tribulations, and with a few short, insightful words, he consistently helped me untangle complex problems and understand how to proceed. His wisdom and perspective were invaluable.

A special and heartfelt thank you is reserved for my wife, Elaine. As a lawyer, her tolerance for dense text is matched only by her sharp eye for detail—both of which were indispensable gifts to this project. She patiently read every single word at least ten times, and her contribution to this work is immeasurable.

Finally, I wish to acknowledge my students. Their intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm for learning were a constant source of motivation. It was my desire to be a more effective and knowledgeable teacher for them that provided the final impetus to see this project through to its completion. You reminded me daily of why this work matters.
